## A. CURATION RATIONALE 

The words selected for this resource are taken from Mexican, Finnish and German goverment texts. These texts were manually searched on government websites. In choosing texts, the main focus was put on relevant terms of general communication in different fields of the topic of COVID-19 (masks, rules, recommendations,...). Some terms were specifically searched for in search functions of the websites. Generally, each annotator applied their own idea of what terms are relevant based on the impression gained from the government communication which was read.
