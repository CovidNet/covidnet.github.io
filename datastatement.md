# Data Statement for CovidNet

> **How to use this document:**
> Fill in each section according to the instructions. Give as much detail as you can, but there's no need to extrapolate. The goal is to help people understand your data when they approach it. This could be someone looking at it in ten years, or it could be you yourself looking back at the data in two years.

> For full details, the best source is the original Data Statements paper, here: https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/Q18-1041/ .

> Instruction fields are given as blockquotes; delete the instructions when you're done, and provide the file with your data, for example as "DATASTATEMENT.md". The lists in some blocks are designed to be filled in, but it's good to also leave a written description of what's happening, as well as the list. It's fine to skip some fields if the information isn't known.

> Only blockquoted content should be deleted; the final about statement should be left intact.

## A. CURATION RATIONALE 

> *Explanation.* Which texts were included and what were the goals in selecting texts, both in the original collection and in any further sub-selection? This can be especially important in datasets too large to thoroughly inspect by hand. An explicit statement of the curation rationale can help dataset users make inferences about what other kinds of texts systems trained with them could conceivably generalize to.

The words selected for this resource are taken from Mexican, Finnish and German goverment texts. These texts were manually searched on government websites. In choosing texts, the main focus was put on general communication in different fields of the topic of COVID-19 (masks, rules, recommendations,...). Some terms were specifically searched for in search functions of the websites.

## E. SPEECH SITUATION

> *Explanation.* Characteristics of the speech situation can affect linguistic structure and patterns at many levels. The intended audience of a linguistic performance can also affect linguistic choices on the part of speakers. The time and place provide broader context for understanding how the texts collected relate to their historical moment and should also be made evident in the data statement. Specifications include:

* Description: 
* Time: 
* Place: 
* Modality (spoken/signed, written): 
* Scripted/edited vs. spontaneous: 
* Synchronous vs. asynchronous interaction: 
* Intended audience: 

## F. TEXT CHARACTERISTICS

> *Explanation.* Both genre and topic influence the vocabulary and structural characteristics of texts (Biber, 1995), and should be specified.

## G. RECORDING QUALITY

> *Explanation.* For data that include audiovisual recordings, indicate the quality of the recording equipment and any aspects of the recording situation that could impact recording quality.

## H. OTHER

> *Explanation.* There may be other information of relevance as well. Please use this space to develop any further categories that are relevant for your dataset. 

## I. PROVENANCE APPENDIX

> *Explanation.* For datasets built out of existing datasets, the data statements for the source datasets should be included as an appendix.


## About this document

A data statement is a characterization of a dataset that provides context to allow developers and users to better understand how experimental results might generalize, how software might be appropriately deployed, and what biases might be reflected in systems built on the software.
